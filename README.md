# dreid_v2
Taking the lessons learned from dreid_v1, this is a re-factoring and organization of the project into several distinct components:
- dreidlib - library containing the class implementations
- cli - the dreid_v2 command line interface with interactice mode
- dreiddblib - library contiaing database class implementations
